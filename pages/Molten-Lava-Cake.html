    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p style="border: 0px;background-color: aquamarine;">
            What could be better than a chocolate cake for dessert?
            How about a chocolate cake served warm with a river of chocolate running from it?
            Using dark chocolate produces a molten lava cake that's better than any you'll ever
            get in a restaurant.


            The story of this molten chocolate cake begins with 80's nostalgia. As legend has it, in 1981,
            three-star French chef Michel Bras was inspired to create a cake that invoked the feelings of
            a warm cup of hot chocolate. The resulting recipe placed a ball of ganache in the center of 
            chocolate cake;
            when the cake bakes, the ganache becomes a liquid center. Six years later, 
            chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten accidentally created the most common variation when he slightly 
            under-baked chocolate cupcakesâ€”the crowd and soon country gave a standing ovation for the dessert
        
            There is no right or wrong method here, but we like Vongerichten's ideation for its ease,
            fewer dirty dishes, and luxurious gooey center. We use a high oven temperature to set
            the outside of the cake,while leaving the inside slightly fluid. At the end of the bake,
            the internal temperature of the cakes should read 160 F to ensure the eggs are fully cooked.
            Much like a souffle, we whip the eggs and yolks to a thick consistency to give both tenderness
            and structure to the cake.
            Just a hint of flour is required to give the cakes the strength to stand up when inverted.

             <li>
                <p>
                        Lightly grease 4 (6-ounce) ramekins, then dust with cocoa powder and tap out any excess. 
                        Ensure the ramekins are well coated in cocoa powder as this helps prevent the cake from sticking. 
                        Preheat oven to 450 F.

                        beat the eggs, yolks, sugar, and salt on medium speed until thickened, pale, and almost tripled in volume, about 6 minutes.

    <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p  >

                For chocolate flavor that really hits you in the feels, stir 1 tablespoon of espresso powder into
                the melted chocolate and butter before folding into the eggs.
                Since chocolate is the star here, make sure you use the highest quality. We like to go for baking
                bars that are at least 60% cacao or more.
                The baking time can vary depending on your oven and how molten you would like your cakes to be.
                If you insert a thermometer in the middle of the cakes, the batter should reach 160 F to ensure 
                the eggs in the batter are cooked. This will help you determine when the cakes are ready and 
                avoid overbaking.

        <h3>Make Ahead</h3>
        <p>

            You can prepare the batter ahead of time and portion into the ramekins,
            then cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Allow to come to room 
            temperature before baking.

       <h3>Recipe Variations</h3>
        <p >

                * Dusting the ramekins with cocoa powder helps the cakes release when inverted, 
                but you can dust them with sugar, flour, or even freeze-dried fruit that's been 
                blitzed in a food processor until fine.

                * You can add a number of different flavorings to the batter,
                  including:
        </p>
    
        <!--ul-->
        <ul>
                <li>Orange zest</li>
                <li>Vanilla extract</li>    
                <li>Bourbon or bourbon extract</li>
                <li> Caramel</li>
                <li>Ground freeze-dried fruit</li>
                <li>Spices like cardamom, cinnamon, or even chili pepper</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>How to Store</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
             <p> 

                 You can store baked and cooled lava cakes in an airtight container in the refrigerator 
                 for up to 3 days.
                
              </p>  
        </li>

        <li>Reheat cakes in the microwave in 30-second bursts until warm.</li>
    </ul>
