                Quark is a creamy, mild <strong style="color: blue;">fresh cheese</strong> common throughout Northern and Eastern Europe.
                It’s consumed on its own as a breakfast food, similar to Greek or Icelandic yogurt,
                and incorporated into dips, baked goods, and other recipes. 
                Quark is a good source of calcium and is high in protein and low in fat compared 
                to other fresh cheeses.

        <h3>What Is Quark?</h3>
        <p>

            
                Quark is the name for the German version of a mild-tasting,
                spreadable, unaged cheese that has been produced in areas 
                of Northern and Eastern Europe since at least Roman times.
                It's often consumed for breakfast or spread on bread, but
                it can also be used in baking and cooking. Because quark 
                is simply cultured and strained and not aged, it has a 
                very mild, milky flavor and texture more reminiscent of 
                yogurt than cheese.

            <h3>How Querk is made</h3>
        <p>

                To make quark, pasteurized milk is gently warmed,
                then cultures are stirred in. Some quark manufacturers
                add a very small amount of <strong style="color: blue;">rennet</strong> at this point to 
                strengthen the coagulation of the milk and remove more whey, 
                which creates a slightly firmer texture in the finished product.
                The milk is then allowed to culture and cool to around 
                70 F over 12 to 24 hours, during which it coagulates into a soft curd.
                The longer the quark sits, the firmer and tangier it will be.

                The curd is gently ladled into a fine strainer or muslin bag to
                drain for another 12 to 24 hours. The<strong style="color: blue;"> cheesemaker</strong> can control
                the texture of the cheese during this step: a shorter draining 
                time means more moisture in the cheese and a softer finished product,
                while a longer draining time will make for a firmer, drier cheese.
                Depending on how the cheese will be used, a small amount of cream
                may be added to the cheese to add richness. The quark may also be
                whipped to create a lighter, airier texture before packaging.

                          Other soft, spreadable, fresh cow's milk cheeses such as fromage blanc,
                          cream cheese, soft <strong style="color: blue;">farmers' cheese</strong>, and <strong style="color: blue;">labneh </strong>or kefir cheese may be
                          used in place of quark in recipes, although you’d want to skip putting
                          American cream cheese on a cheese board. In dishes in which the cheese
                          will melt into other ingredients, whole-milk yogurt could also be used.
                          Chèvre, made with goat's milk, is another alternative, although the 
                           flavor profile may be tangier and earthier than that of quark.

                        In addition to the typically soft, smooth German quark,
                        similar cheeses are made across Northern and Eastern Europe,
                        like tvorog in Russia, rahka in Finland, and topfen in Austria. 
                        While it's typically drier and more crumbly than quark, 
                        the French make fromage blanc, a fresh, tangy cow's milk cheese.
                        In the United States, the Pennsylvania Dutch make a similar
                         cheese called Schmierkase. Often, the soft, spreadable versions 
                        of what's known as farmers' cheese in the United States are very much like quark.

            <h3> Uses</h3>
        <p>
           
                    Traditionally, quark is eaten with jam or fresh berries, often for breakfast.
                    In Germany, it's also used as the main ingredient in Kaesekuchen, or cheesecake.
                    It can be used similarly to substitutes like fromage blanc or cream cheese:
                    spread on bread, bagels, or other baked goods; baked into sweet or
                    savory dishes, added to casseroles, <strong style="color: blue;">macaroni and cheese</strong>, or soups to
                     add moisture and creaminess; and dolloped into quiches or tarts.
                    It's excellent as the base for flavored dips or spreads such as Krautkaese,
                    which includes chopped onions and fresh herbs like chives and parsley 
                    and is served over baked potatoes. Quark can also be used as a filling
                    for pastries, pastas, crepes, and pierogi.

            <h3>Storage</h3>
        <p>
            
                Store quark sealed in an airtight plastic or glass container
                in the coldest part of your refrigerator. Look for a printed expiration
                date on the package—the cheese should be good to consume through that date.
                It can also be stored in your freezer for up to three months.
                    Thaw frozen quark overnight in the refrigerator and stir to reincorporate 
                    any liquid that has separated. Quark that has grown mold on its surface
                    or smells like spoiled milk should be discarded.
