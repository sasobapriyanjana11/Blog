                Hoop cheese is the name of a mild, semisoft cow's milk
                cheese originating in the American South. Other names
                include red ring cheese or baker's cheese. Today,
                the name may be used to refer to this traditional 
                cheese or to modern versions that more closely resemble
                cheddar cheese.

            <h3>What Is Hoop Cheese?</h3>
            <p>
    
            
                Hoop cheese is a highly perishable, semisoft to semifirm cheese produced in
                the Southern United States in the 19th century and the first half of the
                20th century. It was typically displayed for sale at small-town town general 
                stores, where the proprietor would cut wedges for customers to order using 
                a special cheese cutter. The wheel sat on a rotating round board, 
                with a large knife suspended above that could cut a wedge of a 
                precise weight for a customer.<br>
    
                Hoop cheese is similar to simple, fresh cheeses such as farmer's cheese,
                which is made with milk, cream, and salt, or dry-curd cottage cheese,
                which is typically salted. However, traditional hoop cheese is made
                from cow's milk only, with no salt or cream added. Because of this
                , the cheese had a much shorter shelf life than aged cheeses,
                only one to two weeks. It also has a very mild, neutral flavor 
                and a rubbery texture when young. Because it was so perishable,
                hoop cheese was typically made by the store owner or a nearby
                cheesemaker or farmer and was not mass produced or transported 
                for sale outside of the area where it was produced.

            <h3>What's in a Name? </h3>

        <p>
        
                Hoop cheese got its name from the hoop-shaped molds that were 
                used to drain and shape the<strong style="color: blue;">curds</strong> . It's also called red ring cheese, 
                after the red-wax coating typically applied to wheels. Baker's cheese,
                 the name for the soft, fresh version of hoop cheese, is so named 
                 because it's often used to make baked goods such as cakes and pies.

            <h3>How Hoop Cheese Is Made</h3>
        <p>

            
                        Raw milk is heated in a large vat, and then cultures, beneficial
                        bacteria used in<strong style="color: blue;">cheesemaking</strong> , are added to the milk.
                        Depending on the recipe, rennet may be added to coagulate the milk,
                        or the milk may be coagulated by allowing it to culture for several hours.

                        The curd is cut with a large knife into half-inch pieces,
                        then the curds and whey are heated and stirred to remove moisture.
                        When the curds are springy and rubbery, they are drained into
                        wide, round cheese molds lined with cheesecloth and pressed 
                        firmly to remove all remaining <strong style="color: blue;">whey</strong>. The 22-pound wheels 
                        are coated in red or black wax before being cut and sold by 
                        the piece to customers.

                        Today, hoop cheese is still produced and sold, but it more often resembles 
                        a mild cheddar cheese. Contemporary versions may be produced with the addition
                        of salt and annatto, which adds a bright orange color. Modern hoop cheese 
                        may be aged to have a sharper flavor. Hoop cheese can be found at small 
                        grocery stores, restaurants, and gas stations across the American South 
                        or purchased online. It's also produced and sold by cheesemakers in Wisconsin.
    
                        The name hoop cheese or baker's cheese may also be used to refer to a softer,
                        fresh cheese similar to farmer's cheeseâ€”basically the drained curds of hoop
                        cheese before they have been pressed and waxed.

                Mild, semisoft cheeses such as young cheddar or Monterey Jack 
                can be used as a substitute for hoop cheese in recipes. 
                Dry-curd cottage cheese or ricotta cheese may be used as 
                a substitute for baker's cheese.

            <p>
    
                Hoop cheese can be eaten as a table cheese, on sandwiches,
                 or used in cooking. It can be used as a soft, creamy
                  melting cheese along with a sharper, more flavorful cheese 
                  in macaroni and cheese recipes or grated and melted into casseroles. 
                  Hoop cheese is also a traditional ingredient in pimento cheese spread.
