                It's correct to assume that Kentucky coffee combines bourbon and coffee. While it is a simple recipe, a little honey liqueur is tossed into the mix to sweeten things up. It's a tasty combination that was made with whiskey drinkers in mind and is sure to keep you warm on the coldest days of the year. Bourbon is a perfect complement to coffee. The whiskey often features big vanilla and caramel overtones and some impart notes of cinnamon and spice as well. <br>This recipe calls for the bold flavor and natural spiciness of Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon and the brand's American Honey Liqueur. It's an all-American spiked coffee that celebrates Kentucky bourbon at its best. Dress up the drink with a little whipped cream if you like, which will soften the flavors a bit. Then again, it's fabulously robust when left as is, especially if you choose a strongly brewed dark roast or bourbon barrel-aged coffee beans.

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p>
                Avoid those last few sips of cold coffee by warming up your glass: Fill the mug with hot water while the coffee's brewing or heat a water-filled mug in the microwave for about 10 seconds. Dump out the water, then build your drink. Your average coffee from that reliable drip coffee maker will create a nice drink. Yet, a better Kentucky coffee can be made by beginning with a thicker, richer coffee. For cocktails, consider brewing with a French press or use a pour-over method. You could also start with fresh-brewed espresso and add hot water (caffé Americano style) to increase the volume.

                As an alternative to Wild Turkey American Honey, Evan Williams Honey Reserve is a nice liqueur that also has a bourbon base. Likewise, consider using Barenjäger, a rustic German honey liqueur that's equally impressive. For a spiced twist, skip the honey liqueur and pour a cinnamon whiskey liqueur instead. Look for the "Fire" bottles from whiskey makers like Jim Beam or Jack Daniel's or pick up Fireball. Instead of liqueur, sweeten the Kentucky coffee with a teaspoon or two of raw or brown sugar. Just be sure to stir until the sugar dissolves. Use your favorite coffee creamer instead of whipped cream.

            <h3>How Strong Is the Kentucky Coffee?</h3>
            <p>
                The strength of your Kentucky coffee is going to depend on the amount of coffee you add to the liquor. For instance, if you were to fill an 8-ounce coffee mug and use the two spirits in the recipe, the drink's alcohol content will be right around 9 percent ABV (18 proof). It's relatively mild and that's why it's so soothing.

            <h3>What Are Bourbon Coffee Beans?</h3>
            <p>
                Bourbon barrel-aged coffee beans are a trend in the coffee world. Offered by specialty coffee roasters, they make an excellent cup of coffee. By law, bourbon whiskey must be aged in new charred oak barrels. Since distilleries cannot reuse them, the barrels are often repurposed to age other spirits like rum and tequila. Coffee roasters caught on to the excess of bourbon barrels and started using them to age green coffee beans prior to roasting. Each has a different approach and the methods are often top-secret; some use a long aging process while others roll the beans in the barrel. Whatever the technique, the beans pick up the subtle oak, vanilla, char, and whiskey flavors trapped in the wood, and the flavors are enhanced when the beans are roasted. Though unlikely, if any alcohol is absorbed, only trace amounts will make it into the brewed coffee. There is another type of Bourbon coffee. It comes from a specific variety of the Arabica coffee plant (Coffea Arabica var. Bourbon) that originated on the island of Réunion, which was formerly known as Bourbon. No whiskey or barrels are involved; it's simply a special coffee bean that makes a great cup of java.
